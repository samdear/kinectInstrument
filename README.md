This project uses the Xbox Kinect to create a depth and location based looper. 

An interactive sound sampler that uses depth and location using the Xbox Kinect combined with sound reactive visuals.

A demo of this project can be found on my blog: www.samdearmas.com/seeing-machines/kinectinstrument
